## About starward

starward began as an educational project to create a professional-grade astronomy toolkit that implements calculations from first principles, without relying on external astronomy libraries. The goal is to provide both a practical tool and a learning resource for understanding celestial mechanics.

### Philosophy

> *"Per aspera ad astra" — Through hardships to the stars*

The project is guided by several principles:

- **Educational First** — Code should teach as well as compute
- **Zero Dependencies** — All astronomy calculations implemented from scratch
- **Professional Quality** — Production-ready with comprehensive testing
- **Beautiful Output** — Rich terminal formatting that makes data shine

### History

| Date | Milestone |
